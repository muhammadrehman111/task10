2. Add initial project files and configuration
3. Document the branch purpose and objectives
I need clarification on your request. Do you want to:

1. Remove the entire section at `$SELECTION_PLACEHOLDER$` (the paragraph about `index.html`)?
2. Replace it with specific content?
3. Remove content that follows it?


I need clarification. You mentioned rewriting content based on `index.html`, but I don't have access to that file. 

Could you please:
1. Share the contents of your `index.html` file
2. Confirm which sections to keep from the current readme
3. Specify what new content should replace the `$SELECTION_PLACEHOLDER$` area

This will help me provide accurate markdown that aligns with your `index.html`.
